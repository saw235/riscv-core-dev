# S1

S1 is a educational project to setup a verifiable single cycle RISC-V core, with simulation, debug, and formal verification flow.

Possibly with interrupt capabilities.

The purpose of this stage of the project is to be educational and builds a foundation of the next core. Because of that, the scope of the project is intentionally set to be simple, and minimal.
